# ulua benchmarks

A small, reproducible benchmark suite comparing **ulua** (this pure-Rust Luau
port) against the reference C++ Luau and other Lua-family runtimes, on both
**execution speed** and **compilation speed**.

## Engines compared

| Engine        | Language        | Kind                          |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **ulua**     | Luau            | pure Rust (this repo)         |
| tsuki         | Lua 5.4         | pure Rust                     |
| lua-rs        | Lua 5.5         | pure Rust                     |
| C++ luau      | Luau            | reference C++ interpreter     |
| mlua/luau     | Luau            | C Luau via Rust FFI           |
| mlua/lua5.4   | Lua 5.4         | C Lua via Rust FFI            |
| mlua/luajit   | LuaJIT (5.1)    | tracing JIT via Rust FFI      |
| python        | Python 3        | CPython (cross-language baseline) |

Every Lua-family engine runs the **same** Lua program source. The Python engine
runs a line-for-line port in `programs/<name>.py` (Python can't run `.lua`); each
port is written to produce the **identical** checksum. Each program prints a
single checksum, and the harness verifies every engine produces the same one — so
the timings are only trusted when the work was actually done correctly. (They all
agree, Python included.) An engine selects its source file via the optional
`"ext"` key in `engines.json` (defaults to `"lua"`; Python uses `"py"`), and the
harness skips any engine whose binary isn't installed instead of erroring.

## Methodology

- Release/optimized builds throughout (`cargo build --release`; C++ Luau built
  `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`; mlua C sources vendored at `-O3`).
- Wall-clock time of the whole process, median of 7 runs after 1 warm-up.
  Process start-up was measured at well under 10 ms for every engine, i.e.
  negligible against the workloads below.
- Programs (`programs/`) are plain Lua that is valid on Luau, Lua 5.4 and
  LuaJIT alike (no `//`, no bitwise ops, no type annotations); a Park–Miller
  RNG keeps integer math exact in both double and 64-bit-integer engines so the
  checksums match everywhere.
- ulua runs as a **bytecode interpreter** here (no native codegen).
- Numbers below are from one Apple Silicon laptop (macOS, arm64). Treat them as
  ratios and ballparks, not absolutes — rerun locally with `harness.py`.

## Runtime results

Median wall-clock **ms** (lower = faster); `(Nx)` is the slowdown vs C++ Luau.

| Benchmark            | ulua       | tsuki       | lua-rs     | C++ luau | mlua/luau | mlua/lua5.4 | mlua/luajit | python      |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| fib(35)              | 650 (1.4x)  | 449 (1.0x)  | 530 (1.1x) | 471      | 418       | 421         | 58 (0.1x)   | 818 (1.7x)  |
| nbody (500k steps)   | 666 (1.4x)  | 740 (1.6x)  | 803 (1.7x) | 470      | 500       | 668         | 43 (0.1x)   | 1757 (3.8x) |
| mandelbrot 800²      | 1329 (1.0x) | 1123 (0.8x) | 1260 (0.9x) | 1343     | 1331      | 1085        | 1256        | 2921 (2.3x) |
| matmul 200³          | 151 (1.9x)  | 127 (1.6x)  | 124 (1.5x) | 82       | 81        | 109         | 13 (0.2x)   | 690 (8.7x)  |
| tablesort 200k       | 27 (1.0x)   | 71 (2.8x)   | 14 (0.5x)  | 26       | 25        | 62          | 50          | 72 (2.9x)   |
| strings 200k         | 58 (1.1x)   | 64 (1.2x)   | 68 (1.2x)  | 55       | 55        | 71          | 34          | 64 (1.3x)   |

(`python` = CPython 3.12, line-for-line ports in `programs/*.py`, same checksum as
the Lua versions. Its column is from a separate run on the same machine — the
ulua/C++ figures there matched these within run-to-run noise.)

`lua-rs` was added by the focused run below; its `(Nx)` values use the C++ Luau
medians above so the matrix includes the new engine without rerunning every
existing entry.

### Direct lua-rs comparison

Fresh two-engine run on macOS arm64 / Apple M2 Max, comparing this repo against
[`CppCXY/lua-rs`](https://github.com/CppCXY/lua-rs) built from commit `025ee89`
(`cargo build --release -p luars_interpreter`). Both engines ran the same
`programs/*.lua` files, and all checksums matched.

Median wall-clock **ms** over 7 runs; `(Nx)` is the slowdown vs `lua-rs`.

| Benchmark            | ulua       | lua-rs |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| fib(35)              | 549 (1.0x)  | 530    |
| nbody (500k steps)   | 661 (0.8x)  | 803    |
| mandelbrot 800²      | 1321 (1.0x) | 1260   |
| matmul 200³          | 151 (1.2x)  | 124    |
| tablesort 200k       | 27 (2.0x)   | 14     |
| strings 200k         | 60 (0.9x)   | 68     |

Geometric mean: `lua-rs` ran at **0.90× ulua's time**, i.e. **~1.11× faster**
overall on this workload set. The split is mixed: ulua is faster on `nbody`
and `strings`; lua-rs is faster on `fib`, `mandel`, `matmul`, and especially
`tablesort`.

### Average across all benchmarks

Geometric mean of the per-benchmark time ratios (the correct way to average
speed ratios), with **ulua as the baseline**:

| Implementation            | Engine             | Average vs ulua       |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **ulua**                 | Luau, pure Rust    | 1.00× (baseline)       |
| C++ luau (reference)      | Luau, C++          | **1.26× faster**       |
| mlua → luau               | Luau, C via FFI    | 1.27× faster           |
| mlua → Lua 5.4 (PUC-Rio)  | Lua 5.4, C         | ~parity (1.01× slower) |
| tsuki                     | Lua 5.4, pure Rust | 1.08× slower           |
| lua-rs                    | Lua 5.5, pure Rust | 1.11× faster           |
| mlua → LuaJIT             | LuaJIT, JIT        | 3.5× faster            |
| python (CPython 3.12)     | Python 3, C VM     | 2.25× slower           |

Averaged across these six workloads:

- ulua runs at **~0.79× the speed of the reference C++ Luau** (luau ~1.26×
  faster) — a strong result for a faithful, JIT-free pure-Rust port. `mlua→luau`
  lands in the same place, confirming the C engine behaves identically via FFI.
- ulua is **on par with stock PUC-Rio Lua 5.4** and **~1.08× faster than tsuki**;
  `lua-rs` is **~1.11× faster than ulua** on the focused run below. That leaves
  ulua competitive with the canonical C interpreter and mixed against the other
  Rust interpreters.
- **LuaJIT is ~3.5× faster** overall (and 5–15× on tight numeric loops) — the
  tracing-JIT ceiling that no plain interpreter here approaches.
- As a cross-language reference point, **ulua is ~2.25× faster than CPython 3.12**
  on the same workloads (CPython's worst case is `matmul`'s tight nested loops at
  ~8.7× vs C++ Luau; its best is `strings`, where C-level `join`/`%`-format hides
  the interpreter). Both are bytecode VMs with no JIT, so it's a fair apples-to-
  apples interpreter comparison — and the Luau VM comes out clearly ahead.

Per workload, ulua ranges from parity (mandelbrot, tablesort, strings), to ~1.4×
(recursion-heavy fib/nbody), to ~1.9× worst case (matmul) versus C++ Luau.

## Compilation speed

Compiling a generated **2.14 MB / 85,717-line** Luau file to bytecode
(`null` mode = compile + discard), median of 9 runs:

| Compiler             | median ms | MB/s | vs C++ |
|----------------------|-----------|------|--------|
| **ulua-compile**    | 131       | 16.4 | 0.77×  |
| C++ luau-compile     | 170       | 12.6 | 1.00×  |

ulua's compiler is **~1.3× faster** than the reference C++ Luau compiler on
this corpus (both produce identical, mutually-runnable bytecode).

## Reproduce

```sh
# 1. Build this repo's binaries
cargo build --release            # produces target/release/{ulua,ulua-compile}
