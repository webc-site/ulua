//! Send-portability primitives, gated on the `send` feature.
//!
//! This module mirrors mlua's `XRc` / `MaybeSend` / `MaybeSync` machinery
//! ([`mlua-ref/src/types.rs`] + `types/sync.rs`) but in the simpler shape that
//! ulua-rt needs: ulua-rt is **never** `Sync`. Under the `send` feature a
//! [`Lua`](crate::Lua) and all of its handles become `Send` so the whole VM can
//! be **moved** to another thread; they are *not* usable concurrently. The user
//! guarantees serialized access (exactly mlua's documented `send` contract).
//!
//! ## What `send` changes
//!
//! - [`XRc<T>`] aliases `Arc<T>` (atomically reference-counted, `Send`) instead
//!   of `Rc<T>`. The shared `LuaInner` / `LuaRef` handles use it, so cloning a
//!   handle across the `Send` boundary keeps the refcount sound.
//! - [`MaybeSend`] gains a `Send` super-bound, so every type-erased callback /
//!   userdata closure box stored inside the VM is `Send`, and the captured
//!   environment can hold `Send` data moved in from another thread.
//! - The raw `*mut lua_State` pointers held by `LuaInner` (and, transitively,
//!   every handle) are made `Send` with a documented `unsafe impl Send` (the
//!   move-not-share contract). We deliberately do **not** impl `Sync`.
//!
//! Without the feature everything is byte-for-byte identical to the original
//! single-threaded build: `XRc` = `Rc`, and `MaybeSend` / `MaybeSync` are empty
//! marker traits blanket-implemented for every type (zero bound, zero cost).
