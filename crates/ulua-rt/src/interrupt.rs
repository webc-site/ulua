//! Luau interrupt support. Mirrors `mlua::Lua::set_interrupt` / `VmState`.
//!
//! Luau's VM calls a single global `interrupt` callback at safepoints (loop
//! back-edges, calls/returns, GC). mlua exposes this as `Lua::set_interrupt`,
//! taking a Rust closure that returns a [`VmState`] telling the VM whether to
//! continue or to **yield** the current coroutine.
//!
//! ulua's `lua_callbacks().interrupt` is a plain C function pointer, so we
//! install a fixed trampoline ([`interrupt_trampoline`]) and keep the Rust
//! closure in a thread-local keyed by the VM's *global* pointer (shared by all
//! threads of one `Lua`). The trampoline looks up the closure, runs it with a
//! borrowed [`Lua`], and:
//!
//! * `Ok(VmState::Continue)`  — returns normally; the VM keeps executing.
//! * `Ok(VmState::Yield)`     — calls `lua_break`, which sets the running
//!   thread's status so the VM unwinds back to `lua_resume` (a *yield* at a
//!   yieldable point; ignored otherwise, exactly like upstream Luau).
//! * `Err(e)`                 — raises `e` as a Lua error via `lua_error`.
