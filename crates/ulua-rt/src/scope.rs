//! The [`Scope`] type: lifetime-bounded callbacks and userdata.
//!
//! Mirrors `mlua::Scope`. Constructed by [`Lua::scope`], a `Scope` lets you
//! create Lua callbacks and userdata that borrow **non-`'static`** data from the
//! enclosing stack frame. When the `scope` call returns (normally, via `?`, or
//! through a panic), every object the scope created is *invalidated*: its boxed
//! Rust closure / wrapped data is dropped (ending the borrows) and the
//! underlying Lua object is neutralised so any later use from Lua errors with
//! [`Error::CallbackDestructed`] / [`Error::UserDataDestructed`] instead of
//! touching freed memory.
//!
//! ## The soundness argument
//!
//! [`Scope::create_function`] accepts a closure `F: Fn(&Lua, A) -> Result<R> +
//! 'scope` — i.e. **not** `'static`. The callback machinery
//! ([`create_callback_function`](crate::callback)) is monomorphized over the
//! concrete `F`, so the box can be stored in the function's upvalue userdata
//! **without erasing its lifetime** — the callback path involves no `transmute`.
//!
//! Lua may nevertheless keep the resulting [`Function`] handle past the end of
//! `'scope` (e.g. stored in a global). Safety then rests entirely on the
//! **scope-exit invariant**:
//!
//! 1. On scope exit, *before* returning to the caller (and therefore before any
//!    `'scope`-borrowed data can be dropped), every registered destructor runs.
//! 2. A callback's destructor ([`destruct_callback`](crate::callback))
//!    `take()`s the boxed closure out of the function's upvalue slot and drops
//!    it — ending the borrows right there. The slot reads `None` afterwards;
//!    the Lua function object itself stays valid, but any post-scope call
//!    surfaces as `CallbackError { cause: CallbackDestructed }`, never a
//!    use-after-free.
//! 3. A userdata's destructor `take()`s the wrapped value out of its cell
//!    (dropping the borrowed data) while leaving the cell memory valid; later
//!    dispatch finds `None` and returns [`Error::UserDataDestructed`].
//!
//! Because `'scope` outlives nothing the closures borrow until *after* the
//! destructors have run, no borrow can dangle. The destructors are run by a
//! drop guard (the `destructors` field's `Drop`), so they execute even if the
//! user closure returns `Err` or panics — preserving the invariant on every
//! exit path.
//!
//! The destructor list holds only `'static` neutralisers: what
//! [`Scope::create_function`] / [`Scope::create_userdata`] register are boxed
//! closures over `'static` Lua handles (`Function` / `AnyUserData`) — the
//! bodies are generic over the non-`'static` `F`/`T`, but a body's type
//! arguments are not part of the closure's captured regions, so no lifetime
//! erasure happens anywhere in this module. The list is drained by
//! [`Destructors`]' `Drop` inside `Lua::scope`'s body, while the data the scope
//! borrowed is provably still alive (the whole call is nested within `'env`).
//!
//! The two-lifetime shape `Scope<'scope, 'env>` mirrors mlua: `'env` is the
//! lifetime of the data borrowed *into* the scope, `'scope` the (shorter)
//! lifetime of the scope itself. The returned `Function`/`AnyUserData`
//! handles are **not** `'scope`-bounded and may escape the closure — safety
//! comes from scope-exit neutralisation (the destructor list), not from the
//! type system.
//!
//! ## The `send` contract
//!
//! A scope-created callback may be dropped (neutralised) on whatever thread
//! currently owns the VM. `F: MaybeSend` therefore requires the closure to be
//! `Send` under the `send` feature — the same discipline as
//! [`Lua::create_function`](crate::Lua::create_function): only closures whose
//! captures are all `Send` may travel with the (move-only) VM across threads.
//! Unlike the previous dyn-based design, this is now checked by the type system
//! instead of being asserted through an `unsafe transmute`.
