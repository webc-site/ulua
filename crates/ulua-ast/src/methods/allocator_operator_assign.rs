impl Allocator {
  // The C++ source defines `Allocator& operator=(Allocator&&) = delete;`.
  // In Rust, this is represented by not implementing the `Copy` or `Clone` traits,
  // and specifically not providing a move-assignment equivalent if the type
  // is intended to be pinned or non-assignable.
  // Since it is explicitly deleted in C++, we do not provide a functional implementation.
