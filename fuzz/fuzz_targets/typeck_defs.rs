// `check_with_definitions` with generated host definition files — the exact
// shape of issue #6's SIGSEGV (repeated calls / larger definitions). The `typeck`
// target only fuzzed `check` (no defs), which is how that crash slipped through.
//
// Throughput note: unlike `typeck`/`typeck_typed`, this target can't use the
// reusable `ulua_rt::Checker`. Host definitions are loaded by *mutating* the
// shared global scope (`load_definition_file`: unfreeze -> load -> freeze), and
// each fuzz input generates *different* defs — reusing one cached environment
// would accumulate/conflict declarations across inputs. Caching the builtins here
// would require snapshotting and restoring the global type scope around every
// input; that's deferred (the global scope is a complex arena-backed structure
// and a faithful snapshot/restore is its own change). So each input pays the
// builtin-registration cost via the one-shot `check_with_definitions`.
//
// The old 3x inner loop (added to reproduce #6's repeated-call crash) is dropped:
// #6 is fixed, and AFL's persistent mode already re-runs the target many times
// per input, so the loop only tripled cost without adding coverage.
