# features and combinations no generator invents, so AFL starts from deep-valid
# inputs and mutates outward (the rustc-fuzzing "splice real files" idea).
#
# Sources (all permissively licensed — see fuzz/CORPUS_ATTRIBUTION.md):
#   * this repo's vendored Luau conformance suite (crates/ulua-conformance/…)
#   * the upstream Luau language repo's test scripts (luau-lang/luau, MIT)
#
# The corpus lives in fuzz/corpus/<target>/ (gitignored — not committed, no repo
# bloat); re-run this any time to refresh it. run_afl.sh prefers it over the
# small curated fuzz/seeds/ set when present.

# Only the DIRECT-SOURCE targets take a Luau program as raw bytes (`from_utf8`),
# so real programs are genuine seeds for them. The GENERATOR targets
# (typeck_typed, typeck_defs, structured, determinism, roundtrip) drive a grammar
# from the bytes via `generate*()` — a .luau file is just random driver bytes
# there, NOT a meaningful seed, so staging the corpus for them does nothing. To
# leverage real scripts for those code paths, use the AST splicer (`splice`
# target / `ulua_fuzz::generate_spliced`), which parses real scripts and
# recombines their statements into new valid-ish programs.
