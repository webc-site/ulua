# Minimize the seed corpus once (cached in corpus-cmin/<target>) before fuzzing.
# A rich corpus (fetch_corpus + gen_corpus) has many seeds that add no new
# coverage; AFL floods the dry run with "No new instrumentation output, test case
# may be useless" warnings on each. `cmin` keeps only the coverage-distinct
# inputs, so the dry run is clean (and the fuzzer starts from a leaner set).
#
# cmin runs SINGLE-WORKER with the AFL forkserver DISABLED — both are mandatory on
# macOS:
#   * AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1: with the forkserver on, afl-showmap's batch execs hang on
#     macOS — every seed times out (~5s) and records an EMPTY coverage map, so cmin
#     "narrows down to 0 files" and nukes the corpus. Disabling the forkserver runs
#     each seed fresh (like cmin's own reference exec, which always worked) — it's
#     both correct AND ~70x faster (120 seeds: 100s+/garbage -> ~4s/118 kept).
#   * single-worker: parallel mode (-T) stays broken even with the forkserver off
#     (it hangs / never returns on macOS). No -T.
# Cost is (#seeds x exec_time) at ~0.03-0.07s/seed: seconds for the 250-seed
# targets, ~2min for compile (4162). ONE-TIME and cached in corpus-cmin/<target> —
# every later launch reuses it and starts instantly. Progress streams to the
# terminal. -t (default 5000ms) is just a safety cap now that execs are fast. Skip
# with AFL_NO_CMIN=1; delete corpus-cmin/<target> to refresh; tune with CMIN_T=<ms>.
